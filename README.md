# maproulette-unit-count-fixes
A challenge to find small buildings with large unit counts (probably are garages or one building on a parcel of several)

## Next steps
1. Write script to find properties with several buildings including one very small one (possible garage)
2. Request building data to help locate any possible garages
3. Plan update strategy

Could separately handle this through tasking manager...
